AI Act Article 4, 12 & 19 Compliance Methodology for Automotive R&D

I build output-driven training programs that bridge the gap between 
ADAS engineering teams and audit-ready compliance documentation.

Instead of teaching theory, teams produce actual artifacts during sessions:
— Logging Schemas (Article 12)
— Log Control Procedures (Article 19)  
— Audit Defense Briefs
— Infrastructure Implementation Specs

Currently working with automotive OTA and connected vehicle teams 
preparing for the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline.
